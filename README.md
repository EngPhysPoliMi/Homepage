# Engineering Physics Database Homepage

Welcome to the (un)official [Engineering Physics](https://www.ccs-fisica.polimi.it/en/home) repository!

Here you will find a collection of notes, cheat sheets, exams previews and other resources to help you succeed in your studies.

This project is the result of many years of effort from different students and is still under active development, so any contribution is very much appreciated.


## Use instructions

To make it truly accessible to anyone, here's an easy introduction to GitHub.


### Accessing materials

Not all files can be previewed on the GitHub page, but there is always the possibility to download them on your device.


#### Downloading a single file

1) Navigate to the file using the repository explorer above.
2) Click on the file.
3) On the right side of the file view, look for the “Download” button, or simply click on the "Raw" button, then right-click and select "Save As..." to save the file to your device.


#### Downloading the entire repository
1) On the main page of the repository, look for the green "Code" button.
2) Click on it and select "Download ZIP". This will download the entire repository as a compressed file.
3) Extract the ZIP file on your device to access the contents.


### Contributing
You might want to add a file, update one, change a name, open a repository about a new subject of the course, structure a repository differently, or something else entirely.
To do that, you have to open an issue that ultimately must be approved (resolved) by an admin.

Changes to the structure, i.e. opening a repository or the ordering of directories, must be requested on [this](https://github.com/EngPhysPoliMi/Homepage) page, to be considered the main repository.

Changes to files and local directories must be requested directly on the subject repository.

Advanced users can choose to make a "pull request" but it's arbitrary.


#### Requesting Changes

If you notice any mistakes or think that something should be updated in the notes, please feel free to report it following these steps:

1) Click on the "Issues" tab at the top of the repository.
2) Click on "New Issue".
3) Describe the change you'd like to see, and provide as much detail as possible. Click "Submit" when you’re done.


#### Requesting the Upload of a New File

To request the addition of a new file or resource, follow these steps:

1) Open an Issue: As with requesting a change, click the "Issues" tab.
2) Click "New Issue".
3) Drag and drop the file in the issue description with a short definition of what's being added. Click "Submit" when you’re done.


## Subjects

Subjects are sorted by the scheme `x.y - "name"`
- x = (1; 2; 3; M), being the year of teaching.
- y = (1; 2), being the semester.
